        `Sharp, cool whites, with considered use of bold color and unique textures, exemplify the north facing apartment’s ‘art
        gallery’ aesthetic.`,
        `A light reflecting, brushed aluminum kitchen island, with integrated sink and seating overhang ground an opened
        kitchen plan. A single wall of flat-front, panel-ready appliances and millwork merges the kitchen area with the adjacent
        living area. The new living space is enlarged, with the intriguing aluminum island ‘center table’, and surrounding
        circulation underwriting casual, fluid entertaining.`,
        `Prime-grade white oak flooring and stair. Aged ash cladding, floor planks and parapets at exterior deck. Flush, frameless
        doors with minimal or invisible hardware secret away storage and baths. Flush switches and outlets. Reveal baseboards.
        Round, recessed wall wash and downlights at the 1st level. Globe ceiling lights at the 2nd level. Matte walls, with light
        reflecting semi-gloss at the stairwell. Refurbished deck doors and sidelites. New windows. An oversized awning window
        encloses a previously open terrace and further grows the living space. These foundational, museum-inspired finishes
        create a canvas through which declarative, high modern furnishings, colored floor lighting and contrasting rustic wood
        seating become artful, highlighted objects.`,
        `The bath contains honed, cream, and ochre cement tile. A dramatic, full wall mirror doubles the perceived size of the
        small space. Curbless, walk-in shower with wall and floor recessed glass partition. Recessed ceiling showerhead for
        maximal clearance. Minimal chrome fixtures. Hidden storage niche. In-wall vanity bar. A highly functional, while
        directionally designed space.`,
        `The powder room employs hand-cut mosaics, a jute ceiling, surrealist floor standing mirror and plush mat to create a
        North African informed, phantasmagoric, personal inner sanctum adjacent to the bedroom.`

        `Textured materials in muted colors and minimal furnishings, were used to design the apartment’s calming aesthetic.`,
        `Creating a warm, deeply engaging bath was key for the clients. Softly brushed, seamless tadelakt walls anchor the
        space in serenity. A freestanding bathtub with adjacent niche supports extra-long soaking. A curbless walk-in shower
        with glass partition keeps the bath open, uninterrupted. Monochrome matte floor tile, minimal plumbing fixtures, and
        dynamic ‘warm-to-dim’ lighting round out the room’s easeful atmosphere.`,
        `Smoked, rustic-grade white oak flooring at the 1st and 2nd levels. Concrete floor tile at the cellar. Pale gray walls
        throughout. Flush, frameless doors with minimal hardware or inset leather pulls enclose hidden, abundant, in-wall
        storage for quotidian and occasional items. Matte white joists and masonry walls, where exposed. A mix of ceiling
        surface mount and recessed cube lighting. A monochrome, deep gray kitchen with flat fronts, panel ready appliances,
        hidden exhaust, and concealed outlets. Raw steel spiral stair. Together, these foundation finishes set the stage for rightsized,
        iconic Danish furnishings in patinated leather and brushed steel, veined marble, linens, wools, and natural oak.`,
        `Thanks to Kinship Architecture for their architectural collaboration.`

        sidelites. Flush switches and outlets. New 3” electric baseboard heating throughout.`,
        `Custom storage millwork for each of client personal effects and fitness equipment was essential. Outerwear is stored
        behind space saving, lateral hinge closet doors. A hidden closet, opened via touch latch, hides unsightly cleaning
        products and tools. Right sized cubbies and hanging rods allow easy access to exercise tools.`

        Village and across New York City. The installation turns waste into an artfully designed installation piece.`,

        this wall intervention contends that everyday plastic objects have aesthetic value, regardless of their initial purpose’s
        having expired.`,

        manufacturing, bales fashioned by recycling plants here serve as exciting, textural, multicolored partitions.`,
